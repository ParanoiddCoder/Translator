<h1><b>Customized Translator App Using Python</b></h1>

A custom implementation of a translator application was developed using Python. This 
application leverages the googletrans library for translation and the tkinter library for creating 
a graphical user interface (GUI). The tool provides seamless translation functionality and 
incorporates various features, such as:
1. Dynamic Input and Output: Users can input text, select a target language, and view 
the translated output.
2. Clear Functionality: Users can clear both input and output fields to reset the interface.
3. Language Selection: Supports selection of multiple languages via a dropdown menu.
4. Responsive Design: Includes a dynamic background image that resizes with the 
window.
Key Components of the Code
1. Core Translation Logic
The translation is handled using the googletrans. Translator class. It uses the translate method 
to convert the input text to the desired language, identified by language codes.
2. GUI Design
The GUI is implemented using tkinter. Key elements include:
 Text input and output boxes.
 A dropdown for language selection using ttk.
 Buttons for translation and clearing text.
3. Responsive Background
The code includes functionality to dynamically resize a background image when the window 
dimensions change.
